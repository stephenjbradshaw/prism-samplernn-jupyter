## PRiSM SampleRNN (Jupyter Notebook)

This is a version of RNCM PRiSM's [PRiSM SampleRNN Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/gist/relativeflux/10573e9e1b10b1ff45e3a00099259741/prism-samplernn.ipynb#scrollTo=II4WuZilwzWB), adapted for use on GPU-enabled instances in [Amazon SageMaker Studio](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/studio/).

This repository also contains the scripts used to set up the SageMaker Studio environment in which the notebook runs. This is achieved using SageMaker Studio's [lifecycle configurations](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/customize-amazon-sagemaker-studio-using-lifecycle-configurations/).

[PRiSM SampleRNN](https://www.rncm.ac.uk/research/research-centres-rncm/prism/prism-collaborations/prism-samplernn/) is an AI-assisted composition tool that "learns" from audio input to generate new audio output. It is open-source software authored by Dr Christopher Melen, [RNCM PRiSM](https://www.rncm.ac.uk/research/research-centres-rncm/prism/).
